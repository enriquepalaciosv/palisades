        title: "9,000 Years Ago: The Area's First Inhabitants",
        description: "An indigenous Native American people, the Washoe Tribe inhabited lands around Lake Tahoe dating back thousands of years. They hunted, gathered, and traveled on hand-hewn snowshoes in the winter months. Their tribe name comes from the Washoe word, Wašiw, meaning “people from here.” The Washoe first called Lake Tahoe “Da ow ga,” the Washoe word for “lake,” which is thought to be the source for the name Lake Tahoe. Da ow aga is central to the tribe's identity and is still considered the tribe's most sacred place.",

                itemTitle: "1844. Western Migration",
                itemDescription: "An early Western explorer named John C. Fremont climbed Red Lake Peak on Carson Pass while on a mapping expedition and looked out at the distant view of Lake Tahoe, the first reported non-Native to spot the area. After that, the quest for gold and silver brought major western migration and much development to the Lake Tahoe area, including the building of the Central Pacific Railroad and massive deforestation for timber. Cultures clashed, emigrants brought agriculture and western property rights, and wars ensued. The Washoe people were forcibly pushed from their ancestral range and ultimately divided into four communities: Woodfords, Dresslerville, Stewart, and Carson Colony."

        title: "1939. The Poulsens and the Cushings",
        description: "Originally from the Bay Area, Wayne Poulsen spends his youth ski jumping and touring in the Sierra Nevada, working with Dr. Frank Church as a snow hydrographer, jumping in early ski competitions, and eventually helping to start the University of Nevada, Reno’s ski team. After helping to start the ski area now known as Sky Tavern, Poulsen ventured further into the Sierra and fell in love with the stunning valley known as Squaw Valley. In 1939, Poulsen secures an option to buy land in the valley from the Southern Pacific Railroad, and by the mid-1940s, together with his wife, Sandy, the Poulsens build a home to raise their family and pursue their dream of developing Squaw Valley. Poulsen meets Alexander Cushing, an East Coast businessman, while on a ski trip at Alta in 1945, and the two partner, with Poulsen as the expert and Cushing as the financier.",

        title: "1943. The Naming of KT-22",
        description: "Sandy and Wayne Poulsen strap skins to their skis to climb and ski the snow-covered peaks surrounding their home. One of those peaks is so steep, Sandy does 22 kick-turns to make her way down the precipitous north-facing slope. They name the peak KT-22, which will eventually become the site of one of the most legendary chairlifts in North America.",

                itemDescription: "On November 24, 1949, Squaw Valley opens with one chairlift, Squaw One, then the longest double chairlift in the world, and two rope tows. Over the decades that follow, Squaw Valley expands its terrain to include six mountain peaks, spanning 3,600 skiable acres.The opening is a triumph for Cushing, but a painful loss to Poulsen, who was forced out of the company he helped start before the ski area ever opened. Poulsen retains operations of a small ski area that later becomes the Red Dog and Squaw Creek terrain and maintains ownership of much of the land in the valley, including the spectacular Olympic Meadow that he later helps to preserve from destruction."

With word of the Olympics coming to Squaw Valley, Reily envisions a promising future for the entire North Lake Tahoe region. On a day hike through the area, Sally Hudson, mother of future Olympian Bill Hudson, suggests the area should be named “Alpine Meadows.”"
