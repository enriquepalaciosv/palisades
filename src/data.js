      "An indigenous Native American people, the Washoe Tribe inhabited lands around Lake Tahoe dating back thousands of years. They hunted, gathered, and traveled on hand-hewn snowshoes in the winter months. Their tribe name comes from the Washoe word, Wašiw, meaning “people from here.” The Washoe first called Lake Tahoe “Da ow ga,” the Washoe word for “lake,” which is thought to be the source for the name Lake Tahoe. Da ow aga is central to the tribe's identity and is still considered the tribe's most sacred place.",

          "An early Western explorer named John C. Fremont climbed Red Lake Peak on Carson Pass while on a mapping expedition and looked out at the distant view of Lake Tahoe, the first reported non-Native to spot the area. After that, the quest for gold and silver brought major western migration and much development to the Lake Tahoe area, including the building of the Central Pacific Railroad and massive deforestation for timber. Cultures clashed, emigrants brought agriculture and western property rights, and wars ensued. The Washoe people were forcibly pushed from their ancestral range and ultimately divided into four communities: Woodfords, Dresslerville, Stewart, and Carson Colony.",

      "Originally from the Bay Area, Wayne Poulsen spends his youth ski jumping and touring in the Sierra Nevada, working with Dr. Frank Church as a snow hydrographer, jumping in early ski competitions, and eventually helping to start the University of Nevada, Reno's ski team. After helping to start the ski area now known as Sky Tavern, Poulsen ventured further into the Sierra and fell in love with the stunning valley known as Squaw Valley. In 1939, Poulsen secures an option to buy land in the valley from the Southern Pacific Railroad, and by the mid-1940s, together with his wife, Sandy, the Poulsens build a home to raise their family and pursue their dream of developing Squaw Valley. Poulsen meets Alexander Cushing, an East Coast businessman, while on a ski trip at Alta in 1945, and the two partner, with Poulsen as the expert and Cushing as the financier.",

Over the decades that follow, Squaw Valley expands its terrain to include six mountain peaks, spanning 3,600 skiable acres.The opening is a triumph for Cushing, but a painful loss to Poulsen, who was forced out of the company he helped start before the ski area ever opened. Poulsen retains operations of a small ski area that later becomes the Red Dog and Squaw Creek terrain and maintains ownership of much of the land in the valley, including the spectacular Olympic Meadow that he later helps to preserve from destruction.",

The games are the first to be nationally televised, giving many people their first look at the exotic sport of skiing, and kicks off a wave of national interest in the sport. Inside the Olympic Village Lodge, athletes from every country dine together—the first and last time in Olympic history. Walt Disney leads the opening ceremonies, the sports of biathlon and women's speed skating are introduced, and metal skis are used for the first time in ski racing. Computers are utilized for the first time to compute the scores, and the U.S. men's ice hockey team beats the Russians in a major upset that's been called the first miracle on ice.",

In the film, Craig's younger brother, Greg, airs over 100 feet to a stomped landing (on what is now known as Beck's Rock) and Dave Burnham pulls off an 80-foot flip, giving the Palisades its modern-day mantra: “When it doubt, air it out.” By the early 80s, Warren Miller comes to Squaw Valley to film the likes of Scot Schmidt, Tom Day, Jim Zellers, and others, cementing Squaw's reputation as an extreme skier's stomping grounds.",
