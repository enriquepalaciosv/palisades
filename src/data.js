      "An indigenous Native American people, the Washoe Tribe inhabited lands around Lake Tahoe dating back thousands of years. They hunted, gathered, and traveled on hand-hewn snowshoes in the winter months. Their tribe name comes from the Washoe word, Wašiw, meaning “people from here.” The Washoe first called Lake Tahoe “Da ow ga,” the Washoe word for “lake,” which is thought to be the source for the name Lake Tahoe. Da ow aga is central to the tribe’s identity and is still considered the tribe’s most sacred place.",

          "An early Western explorer named John C. Fremont climbed Red Lake Peak on Carson Pass while on a mapping expedition and looked out at the distant view of Lake Tahoe, the first reported non-Native to spot the area. After that, the quest for gold and silver brought major western migration and much development to the Lake Tahoe area, including the building of the Central Pacific Railroad and massive deforestation for timber. Cultures clashed, emigrants brought agriculture and western property rights, and wars ensued. The Washoe people were forcibly pushed from their ancestral range and ultimately divided into four communities: Woodfords, Dresslerville, Stewart, and Carson Colony.",

    description:
      "Originally from the Bay Area, Wayne Poulsen spends his youth ski jumping and touring in the Sierra Nevada, working with Dr. Frank Church as a snow hydrographer, jumping in early ski competitions, and eventually helping to start the University of Nevada, Reno’s ski team. After helping to start the ski area now known as Sky Tavern, Poulsen ventured further into the Sierra and fell in love with the stunning valley that would become the home of Palisades Tahoe. In 1939, Poulsen secures an option to buy land in the valley from the Southern Pacific Railroad, and by the mid-1940s, together with his wife, Sandy, the Poulsens built a home to raise their family and pursue their dream of developing the mountain. Poulsen meets Alexander Cushing, an East Coast businessman, while on a ski trip at Alta in 1945, and the two formed a partnership.<br/><br/>The partnership dissolved prior to the resort opening, with Cushing remaining with the company and serving as the Chairman for the next five decades. Cushing continued to build and expand the resort, and his ambitious vision, led by an imagination undeterred by what was possible at the time, created the identity the resort carries to this day. Cushing built lifts to every peak, introducing skiers to some of the steepest terrain in the country. The challenge of the resort’s steep chutes and granite cliffs attracted the pioneering personalities who would become the founders of the freeskiing movement, as well as Warren Miller, the man who would capture it all on film.",
